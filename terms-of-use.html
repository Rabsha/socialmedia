Those who choose to access this site from locations outside the United States are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Use of the Services</h4><p>The date you kick off with your assigned creative director (kick-off call) is the official start date of your trial and monthly plan. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, as well as your monthly plan for an applicable plan and our timely receipt of your associated payment(s), we will make the applicable Services available to you during the term to which you have purchased.</p><p>You may use the Services for any number of projects and scope that you have purchased for under the applicable monthly plan that can be reviewed at Designity.com/pricing. While we accept unlimited requests and revisions, our output volume depends on many factors, namely depending on your purchased plan and the complexity of your projects. We will provide you with a comprehensive timeline at the beginning of each project to make the deadline and the required steps as clear as possible.</p><p>The speed of the deliverables is determined by your purchased monthly plans. What we can create with a single monthly plan depends on many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the type of plan; (ii) the volume of requests; (iii), and the complexity of requests. To increase the volume of work we can complete within a business day, we suggest you consider our premium plan.</p><p>You are the owner and/or controller of all of your information, data, or materials that you provide to us to use the Services (“Customer Content”). By submitting Customer Content to us, you are representing that you are the owner of such Customer Content and/or have the necessary rights, licenses, and authorization to distribute it. You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to access and use Customer Content to provide the Services.</p><p>You are, and will be, the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the deliverables, including all intellectual property rights therein. We agree that with respect to any deliverables that may qualify as “work made for hire” as defined in 17 U.S.C. §101, such deliverables are deemed a “work made for hire” for you. To the extent that any deliverables do not constitute a “work made for hire,” we irrevocably assign you all right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to the deliverables, including all intellectual property rights therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Section are subject to your compliance with this Agreement and your full payment of applicable amounts due.</p><p>In the course of providing the Services, we may use certain pre-existing materials. We and our licensors are, and will remain, the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title, and interest in and to any pre-existing materials. We grant you a perpetual, limited, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute any pre-existing materials to the extent incorporated in, combined with, or otherwise necessary for the use of the Services or deliverables. We expressly reserve all other rights in and to such pre-existing materials.</p><p>All virtual client interactions with any persons of Designity are recorded for quality assurance purposes. All confidential information shared within these interactions are secured and protected.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Canceling Your Monthly Plan or Trial</h4><p>If you decide to cancel your trial, you don&#x27;t need to pay anything and any processed payment will be refunded. If you decide to continue your plan after the trial, the 2-week trial period counts toward your first month of service and you&#x27;ll be responsible for payment on the final date of your 2-week trial by 11:59 PM. After the 2-week trial, you must pay the fees in full, in such amounts, and for such billing frequency as specified during registration.</p><p>The date you kick off with your assigned creative director (kick-off call) is the official start date of your trial and monthly plan. Upon the cancelation of the trial you will lose your right to use any of the delivered work. There will be serious consequences for using the delivered work if you decide to cancel your trial. New project requests cannot be made under any plan that has already been cancelled. Revision requests can only be made up to 2 business days prior to a plan’s last day.</p><p>All files produced and saved by Designity during a client’s plan will be deleted after 60 days from the termination of the plan. If clients wish for their files to be saved beyond the 60-day period, Designity can save and store the client’s files for $29 per month.</p><p>Although your payment will be set to recurring after the trial, you can always cancel your monthly plan with 7 days notice before the renewal date. To request for cancelation you must submit your request through your dashboard. Once you cancel your monthly plan, you are not required to pay anything at the cancelation or moving forward. You can come back and purchase a new plan whenever you want in the future. If you wish to keep your creative director on hold, you may pause your plan (see section below)*</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Pausing Your Monthly Plan</h4><p>You have the option to pause your monthly plan at any time as long as you have a settled zero balance at the time of your pause request. Pausing helps you save money if you don&#x27;t have enough projects or you&#x27;re busy at the time. Pauses can be made at any time with the exception of circumstances such as pausing due to a creative director notifying you of vacation time. You can either pause your plan for two weeks (for $295) or for an unlimited number of months (for $395 per month). You can also activate your account anytime during the pause and the activation date will be your new start date. Any outstanding days for your plan will be prorated to your reactivated plan. The followings are the benefit of pausing:</p><p>1. You can still consult with your designated creative director to get their brain for any sort of design and marketing matters. You&#x27;ll keep your weekly video calls with your CD as usual and they will reply to your messages as quickly as before.</p><p>2. Your creative director will be always on standby to immediately work on projects whenever you&#x27;re ready to activate your plan. They keep all your branding materials and source files ready so you don&#x27;t need to start from scratch.</p><p>3. You get quarterly VIP consultation from our marketing experts to audit your brand, your website traffic, your marketing campaigns, and more to provide you with unique marketing ideas.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Modifying Your Monthly Plan</h4><p>You have the option to downgrade, upgrade, or customize your plan at any time through your dashboard to our available plans. Any change to your account would be reflected in the upcoming month.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>The Provided Service</h4><p><strong>Unlimited requests and revisions:</strong> You can submit as many project requests as you desire. However, on the Essentials plan, we always add requests to our shared timeline and execute on deliverables in a linear model. If you have a Plus plan, 2 creatives work under the creative director. If you have a Premium plan, 3 creatives work under your creative director supervision. This means more deliverables can be executed for you simultaneously. The final delivery time for each project will be set by your assigned creative director.</p><p><strong>Video Calls:</strong> You could always email your creative director, however the number of video/phone calls is limited to 4 video calls per month for the Essential plan, 8 video calls for the Plus plan and 12 video calls for the Premium plan.</p><p><strong>Scope of Service:</strong> You can rely on us for a variety of design and marketing categories. Some categories are limited to Premium and Plus plans only which can be reviewed at Designity.com/pricing.</p><p><strong>Type of creatives:</strong> We only work with US-based creatives and we have 4 different type of creatives in our network, Emerging Creatives (1-3 Years Experience), Professional Creative (4-7 Years Experience), Accomplished Creatives (8-12 Years Experience), and Creative Directors (13+ Years Experience). Depending on the nature and complexity of the project the creative director may collaborate with different type of creatives to complete your project.</p><p><strong>Stock Images:</strong> All the plans include access to free stock assets and sourcing (images, videos, sound, etc..) Paid stock assets are to be paid by the client and added to their next billing cycle.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Portfolio Rights</h4><p>You hereby grant us a limited, nonexclusive, non-sublicensable, royalty-free worldwide license to use, publish, and display any deliverables that we develop in connection with the Services for the purpose of marketing and advertising (the “Portfolio Rights License”). You may revoke the Portfolio Rights License during the onboarding process or at any time by sending written notice to support@designity.com. If you revoke the Portfolio Rights License, we will stop using your deliverables for marketing and advertising purposes. You understand that your deliverables may continue to exist elsewhere online such as where the deliverables have been used by others in accordance with the Portfolio Rights License.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Business Hours</h4><p>Designity does not operate business on weekends and both federal (Observed Holidays) and company-specific holidays. The following holidays are subject to closed business hours: New Years Day , Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President’s Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Indigenious Peoples Day, Thanksgiving (and day after), Christmas Eve, Christmas Day (and day after), New Years Eve</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>The Associated Monthly Fee</h4><p>Use of our Services requires you to register online with our trial at Designity.com/pricing and agree to these terms and conditions.</p><p>There is no long term commitment to your monthly plan and you can pay for the service through ACH, crypto (Bitcoin or Ethereum), or credit/debit card. You’ll be responsible to pay us on the recurrence you signed up for until you cancel your plan. You can save 5% if you pay on a quarterly basis and 10% if you pay on a yearly basis. You can always adjust the frequency through your Designity dashboard. You can adjust the method of payment by emailing accounting@designity.com.</p><p>If you pay through ACH or crypto you need to make sure we receive the fee on-time before the end of your trial, and moving forward on the corresponding monthly date of the start of your trial (kick-off call date).</p><p>If you pay by credit/debit card, you authorize us to charge your method of payment (e.g. credit card) on the final date of your trial by 11:59 PM, and moving forward for the fee and based upon your chosen billing frequency (e.g. monthly, quarterly, annually). Additional fees apply for payments by credit/debit card. The following chart shows the total monthly rates per plan if paying via credit/debit card: </p><li>Essentials plan: $3,620 per month (instead of $3,495 paying via ACH/wire or Crypto)</li><li>Plus plan: $5,690 per month (instead of $5,495 paying via ACH/wire or Crypto)</li><li>Premium plan: $8,795 per month (instead of $8,495 paying via ACH /wire or Crypto)</li><p>The following payments of your monthly plan are due one day before your plan renews by 11:59 PM unless you cancel your plan through your dashboard at least 7 days in advance before renewal. If you fail to pay on time, your plan will be suspended and you’ll loose access to your creative director and team, as well as the right to use the delivered work. If we don’t receive the recurring payment on time you will be subjected to a $50 penalty each day past your payment due date and your plan will be suspended after 10 days. Reactivating suspended accounts are subject to a $200 reactivation fee.</p><p>All plan payments are due on receipt of invoice and are subject to pricing increases if payments are received after this period. If clients wish to make their payment on other terms, they should reference the pricing increases in the chart below:</p><li>Due upon 30 days: 7% increase in price</li><li>Due upon 45 days: 10% increase in price</li><li>Due upon 60 days and more: 12% increase in price</li><p>Upon the termination of an account, clients have the ability to extend their plan day by day. Daily extensions can be made in the case where clients no longer need a full month of service or need extra days to complete their projects. Essentials plans can be extended for $250 per day, Plus plans for $450 per day and Premium plans for $700 per day.</p><p>Each company is entitled to one trial only every six months. This means if you had a trial within the past 6 months you won&#x27;t be qualified for another trial, however, you can always sign up with Designity without a trial period.</p><p>All the plans can be customized through available add-ons at https://www.designity.com/add-ons</p><p>‍<br/></p><h4>Confidential Information</h4><p>For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means non-public or proprietary information, including, without limitation, information relating to current or future business, products and services, research, images, development, design details and specifications, and marketing plans.</p><p>During the course of our relationship, you may disclose to us your Confidential Information.
